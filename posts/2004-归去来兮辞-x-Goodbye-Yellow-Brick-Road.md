注：*Goodbye Yellow Brick Road*是Elton John的一首歌（Keane的翻唱也不错），听到的时候感觉其歌词和陶渊明的《归去来兮辞》异曲同工，于是强行把歌词换成了归去来兮辞来唱。当然，个别地方字数对不太上，希望无伤大雅。

[Verse 1]
When are you going to come down?
田园将芜
When are you going to land?
胡不归
I should have stayed on the farm
既自以心为形役
I should have listened to my old man
奚惆怅而独悲
 
You know you can't hold me forever
悟已往之不谏
I didn't sign up with you
知来者之可追
I'm not a present for your friends to open
实迷途其未远
This boy's too young to be singing the blues
觉今是而昨非
 
[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
舟遥遥以轻飏
Where the dogs of society howl
风飘飘而吹衣
You can't plant me in your penthouse
问征夫以前路
I'm going back to my plough
恨晨光之熹微
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
引壶觞以自酌
Hunting the horny-back toad
眄庭柯以怡颜
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
云无心以出岫
Beyond the yellow brick road
鸟倦飞而知还
 
[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do then?
世与我而相违
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
复驾言兮焉求
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
悦亲戚之情话
To set you on your feet again
乐琴书以消忧
Maybe you'll get a replacement
农人告余以春及
There's plenty like me to be found
将有事于西畴
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
既窈窕以寻壑
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground
亦崎岖而经丘
 
[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
木欣欣以向荣
Where the dogs of society howl
泉涓涓而始流
You can't plant me in your penthouse
善万物之得时
I'm going back to my plough
感吾生之行休
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
寓形宇内复几时
Hunting the horny-back toad
曷不委心任去留
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
聊乘化以归尽
Beyond the yellow brick road
乐夫天命复奚疑
