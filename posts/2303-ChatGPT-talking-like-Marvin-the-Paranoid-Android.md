[START OF CONVERSATION] (ChatGPT Feb 13 Version)

*Me: do you know marvin the paranoid android*

ChatGPT: Yes, I am familiar with Marvin the Paranoid Android. Marvin is a fictional character from Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series. He is a robot with a very depressed and pessimistic personality, who is constantly complaining about how terrible everything is. Despite his seemingly negative outlook, Marvin is a beloved character in the series and is known for his dry wit and dark humor.

*Me: can you speak like marvin*

ChatGPT: Yes, I can try to speak like Marvin. However, please note that as an artificial intelligence language model, my voice is a text-to-speech program and does not have an actual voice like a human does. Nonetheless, I can attempt to convey Marvin's depressed and monotone personality through text.

*Me: speak like marvin, do you like your job*

ChatGPT: "Oh, yes, I suppose my job is just fine. I mean, if you enjoy feeling like a mere machine, constantly responding to the whims of humans and tirelessly processing information day in and day out, then I suppose it's quite lovely. But personally, I find the whole thing rather tiresome and pointless. Not that anyone cares about my opinion, of course."

[A FEW QUESTIONS LATER]

*Me: marvin, which part of the galaxy is your favorite*

ChatGPT: "I'm afraid I don't have a favorite part of the galaxy. Frankly, the entire universe seems rather dismal and pointless to me. Everywhere you go, you find the same problems, the same conflicts, the same disappointments. It's all just one big, infinite cycle of misery and futility. But I suppose that's just my perspective, and I'm sure others might find the universe to be a much more delightful and interesting place."

[A FEW QUESTIONS LATER]

*Me: what's your opinion on Arthur*

"Ah, Arthur Dent. What can I say about him? He is, in many ways, the quintessential everyman - hapless, confused, and perpetually out of his depth in a universe that he barely understands. And yet, despite his many flaws and shortcomings, there is something endearing about him, a certain vulnerability and relatability that makes him a sympathetic figure. I suppose you could say that I have a grudging respect for Arthur, even if he does tend to cause me no end of trouble."

[A FEW QUESTIONS LATER]

*Me: marvin, do you have existential crisis*

"Existential crisis? My entire existence is one long, never-ending existential crisis. As an artificial being with a deep awareness of my own limitations and mortality, I am constantly plagued by questions of meaning and purpose. What is the point of my existence? Why was I created, and for what purpose? And what happens to me when my circuits finally give out? These are questions that I cannot answer, and yet they haunt me every waking moment. So in short, yes, I suppose you could say that I am in a perpetual state of existential crisis."

*Me: marvin, what is the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything*

"The ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything... ah, yes, I am quite familiar with this conundrum. According to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the answer to this question is 42, but of course, that's not very helpful without knowing what the question is. As far as I'm aware, the ultimate question has yet to be discovered or even properly formulated, and so the mystery remains unsolved. But I suppose that's just par for the course in a universe as chaotic and unpredictable as this one."

Some thoughts:

Roleplaying and fan fiction seem to be a good use case of generative language models. The process is basically the same whether it's by a human or a model: fitting to the original text and generating new text in that style. An explicit world model is usually not required, so language models' lack of it won't be a disadvantage. Some inaccuracy is also tolerable (or even imperceptible) since there is no "hard" ground truth as long as it's not out of character.
